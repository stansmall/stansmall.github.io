<h1>Hello.</h1>

<p> This is a personal website where I share my thoughts. For a long while, I declined to share my thoughts publically, mostly because I never felt I had much to say. However, if I do, by chance, become someone who has something to say, I would like to have it written down. </p>

<p> The title of my website references one of my favorite <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a> which has stuck with me over the years. </p>
